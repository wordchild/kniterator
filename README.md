# Kniterator Pattern Generator

The Kniterator Pattern Generator is a Python programme for generating knitting patterns. 

### Why knitting patterns?

Knitting patterns are written in their own kind of coded language, kind of like a machine language, but for a human interpreter. There are a fixed number of legal knitting operations, and a natural set of physical constraints for producing knitting that makes a knitting pattern generation particularly suited for a programming project – otherwise, it’s a deal of grunt work with a pencil and a calculator.

### What will the Kniterator Pattern Generator do?

In its first incarnation, the Kniterator will be capable of producing patterns for squares and rectangles. Next, the capability of generating patterns for simple shapes in flat knitting produced by increases and decreases (such as trapezoids and triangles) will be added. After that, I will be adding the Kniterator Jumper Generator, which will produce custom knitting patterns for drop shoulder type jumpers based on the end user’s measurement inputs.

In the longer term future, I plan to add further jumper styles (yoke, fitted shoulder, cardigan styles) as well as knit in the round pattern capability to the Kniterator. Other features such as custom stitch pattern specification and intarsia/stranded colourwork/Fair Isle pattern and graphical specification are also on my list.

This is my very first Python project! Thanks for reading: there's more to come.
